# C Fundamentals

## General

- Hello World
  ```c
  printf("hello, world\n");
  ```

- Store integer in variable
  ```c
  int counter = 0;
  ```
  
- Increment by 1
  ```c
  counter = counter + 1;
  ```
  ```c
  counter += 1;
  ```
  ```c
  counter++;
  ```
  
- Conditional Printing
  ```c
  if (x < y)
  {
    printf("x is less than y\n");
  }
  ```
  ```c
  if (x < y)
  {
    printf("x is less than y\n");
  }
  else
  {
    printf("x is not less than y\n");
  }
  ```
  
- Flow Control
  ```c
  while (true)
  {
    printf("hello, world\n");
  }
  ```
